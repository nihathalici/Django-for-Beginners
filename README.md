#  Django for Beginners
This is my repo following the book "Django for Beginners" by William S. Vincent.

Synopsis taken from the book:
„You don’t need previous Python or web development experience to complete this book. It is intentionally written so that even a total beginner can follow along and feel the magic of writing their own web applications from scratch.“
